At Chinook, I focus on extracting actionable insights from music sales data by exploring both objective and subjective questions.
My work aims to inform strategic initiatives within the physical music market.

My analysis aims to support data-driven growth by examining essential trends in music stores, such as customer demographics, buying patterns, and churn rates.

**Summary of the main elements of the project.**
Customer Purchasing Behavior Analysis:- Analyzed customer's purchasing frequency, Identified basket size for each customer, and determined total and average spending amount, Identified top-selling tracks, artists, albums, and genre in each country.

Customer's Retention:- Evaluate churn rates and assess the elements affecting customer turnover, Categorize customers based on their transaction history and interaction levels.

Segment the customer population:- Create categories like new, Existing, and Loyal customers, Examine the average lifetime value, and average order value for each segment.

Customer Risk Profiling: Customer risk profiling is essential! I've identified high-risk segments based on location, and purchasing behavior, allowing us to enhance our targeted retention efforts.

Customer Value Prediction Analysis:-Our Customer Lifetime Value Modeling involves leveraging customer insights to predict their long-term value, which helps us design effective marketing and loyalty strategies.

Power BI was crucial in transforming these insights into clear visualizations, and creating actionable dashboards that showcase key trends and metrics.
